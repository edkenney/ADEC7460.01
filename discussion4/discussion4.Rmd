## Data Set

For this weeks discussion I would like to examine a key theory in modern economics: the Phillips Curve. In short, the curve posits that there is a historical inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation. From the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) I have non-seasonally adjusted monthly data tracking the unemployment rate and the inflation rate in the United States. After importing and combining the data, using the unemployment rate as the response I will build an ETS model, an ARIMA model, and an ARIMA model using inflation as a predictor.

```{r import_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
unemployment = read.csv(file.path(path, "unemployment.csv"))
inflation = read.csv(file.path(path, "inflation.csv"))

unemployment = unemployment %>% 
  rename("date" = "DATE", "unemployment" = "UNRATENSA") %>% 
  mutate(date = yearmonth(date)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = date)

inflation = inflation %>% 
  rename("date" = "DATE", "CPI" = "CPALTT01USM657N") %>% 
  mutate(date = yearmonth(date)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = date)

unemployment %>% 
  autoplot() +
  labs(x = "Unemployment Rate (%)", y = "Date",
       title = "Unemployment Rate in the United States (Jan 1948 - Jun 2023)")

inflation %>% 
  autoplot() +
  labs(x = "Growth Rate (Previous Period)", y = "Date", 
       title = "CPI Growth Rate in the United States (Jan 1960 - Apr 2023)")
```

As seen in the unemployment rate there are cyclical and seasonal affects. Let's reduce the data and combine into a single data set and create our training/testing sets.

```{r combine}
unemployment = unemployment %>% 
  filter(as.Date(date) >= "1960-01-01" & as.Date(date) <= "2023-04-01")

unemployment_data = left_join(unemployment, inflation, by = "date")

total_obs = dim(unemployment_data)[1]
train_obs = floor(total_obs*0.8)
test_obs = total_obs - train_obs

unemployment_train = head(unemployment_data, train_obs)
unemployment_test = tail(unemployment_data, test_obs)
```

## Models

Next, I'll build the three models for the data.

### ETS

```{r ets, warning=FALSE}
ets_auto = unemployment_train %>% 
  model(ETS(unemployment))

report(ets_auto)

ets_auto %>% 
  gg_tsresiduals(lag_max = 12) +
  labs(title = "ETS Model Residuals")

components(ets_auto) %>% 
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "ETS Model (A,Ad,A) Components")

augment(ets_auto) %>% 
  features(.innov, ljung_box, lag = 12)
```

The ETS model does not perform well with this data. We see some significant lag spikes and the Ljung-Box test shows significant autocorrelation. However, I will continue with the data.

### ARIMA

```{r ARIMA}
arima_auto = unemployment_train %>% 
  model(ARIMA(unemployment))

report(arima_auto)

arima_auto %>% 
  gg_tsresiduals(lag_max = 12) +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Model (3,0,1)(1,1,1)[12] Residuals")
```

The ARIMA model performs better on this data set. The absolute value of the AIC is lower than the ETS model and there are no lag spikes with the residuals.

### ARIMA w/ Regressor

```{r arima_regressor}
arima_cpi = unemployment_train %>% 
  model(ARIMA(unemployment ~ CPI))

report(arima_cpi)

arima_cpi %>% 
  gg_tsresiduals(lag_max = 12) +
  labs(title = "Linear ARIMA Model (3,0,1)(1,1,1)[12] Residuals")
```

The ARIMA model with the CPI predictor has a slightly lower AIC, but a higher log likelihood, suggesting a better fit. Like the previous ARIMA model there are no issues with residuals. Now, I will move onto testing.

```{r testing, warning=FALSE}
unemployment_model = unemployment_train %>% 
  model(`ETS` = ETS(unemployment),
        `ARIMA` = ARIMA(unemployment),
        `ARIMA ~ CPI` = ARIMA(unemployment ~ CPI))

unemployment_forecast = unemployment_model %>% 
  forecast(unemployment_test)

unemployment_forecast %>% 
  autoplot(level = NULL, lwd = 1) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Unemployment Rate (%)",
       title = "Model Forecasts",
       subtitle = "Test Set is Black Line") + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Model")) + 
  geom_line(data = unemployment_test, 
            aes(x = date, y = unemployment), 
            lwd = 1.25)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy_table = unemployment_forecast %>% 
  accuracy(unemployment_test) %>% 
  select(-c(.type, MASE, RMSSE)) %>% 
  rename("Model" = ".model")

kable(accuracy_table,
      format = "markdown",
      caption = "Model Accuracy")
```
